# Product Management App
This project is a simple Product Management Application built using React. I created this project to practice core React concepts like state management, hooks, conditional rendering, and basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
The application allows users to add products, search products, edit existing products, delete products, and view them either in a table format or a card format.
